# How to download
* 1. If you are experienced with Git, you can use git commands to clone the repository.
* 2. Go to 
# Setup
* Install Python 3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/ or the Windows Store 
* I am using Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/ as my IDE (You may select any IDE of your choice), remember to run it as Administrator
* In IDE Terminal, run 'pip install -r install.txt' to install required libraries

# How to use
* Run "CodeSpam.py" (Make sure the box to enter code is empty) and do not touch your mouse as it is controlling your mouse to paste codes and button clicking
* To add in codes, go to "CodeInput", and add the code at the end of the line. It is required to HAVE a SPACE between each code!
* To end the script, just ctrl+alt+del

# Note from Me
* It is a shitty script with no GUI just for my own personal use. 
* It will only be used for this LOL 8.8 Anniversary Event.
* If you have any questions, contact: AsianCawFee#8672
