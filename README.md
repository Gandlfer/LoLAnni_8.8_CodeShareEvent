# How to download

* 2. Go to https://github.com/Gandlfer/LoLAnni_8.8_CodeShareEvent > Code > One of the Options

# Initial Setup
* There are 3 images that is needed to be used in the script. Use Snipping Tool (Should be the installed in Windows by default) and save it to captures folder
* 1. The word "Enter Code" where you enter the invitation code. Name it as "InputBox" and format as PNG
* 2. The word "Enter" in the Enter Button. Name it as "Button" and format as PNG
* 3. The word "Confirm" in the Confirm button after you enter a code and press enter. Name it as "Confirm" and format as PNG
* Examples can be refered in the original captures folder. It should be replaced by your own captures. This is because different PC has different pixels so its hard to get a precise image search to compare to

# How to run
* Install Python 3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/ or the Windows Store. (When installing python, remember to tick "Add Python to PATH")
* I am using Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/ as my IDE (You may select any IDE of your choice), remember to run it as Administrator
* In IDE Terminal, run 'pip install -r install.txt' to install required libraries

# How to use
* Run "CodeSpam.py" (Make sure the box to enter code is empty) and do not touch your mouse as it is controlling your mouse to paste codes and button clicking
* To add in codes, go to "CodeInput", and add the code at the end of the line. It is required to HAVE a SPACE between each code!
* To end the script, just ctrl+alt+del

# Important
* Make sure your League Client is 1280x720
* Make sure there is nothing in your "enter code box"

# Note from Me
* It is a shitty script with no GUI just for my own personal use. 
* It will only be used for this LOL 8.8 Anniversary Event.
